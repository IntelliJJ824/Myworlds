	<h2>Mental Health in China and Britain</h2>
		<h3>0.The quantitly of psychologists is limited and students are shy</h3>
		<h3>1.Chinese education is competitive</h3>

		<h4>High rate of students have mental health problem</h4>
		 
		<div id="bg2text">
		<p1>In China</p1>
		   <p2>

Student mental health centers are established in every school. Take my school for example. There are totally 90 classes, 5400 students. However, only about 10 psychology instructors are in the whole seminary. Therefore, not only cannot all the students mental health be counselled but the problem also cannot be regulated on immediate. In addition, Chinese students are not willing to go to the mental health centers, since they are so shy that they are afraid other students regard their mental health as a very serious problem and stayed away from them as consequence. What is more, Chinese education is competitive. For instances, there are about 700,000 senior students having the college entrance examination and only about 200 students can be admitted to the national best school, such as Peking University. Therefore, it is quite normal mental health issues occur to studentsâ€™ daily life. Gradually, an increasing number of mental health problems are accumulated but not noticed or therapy, leading to students suicide.

	      <p1>In Britain</p1>

		 <p2>
According to the recent survey, 78% of university students reported having had a mental health problem over the past year, and 33% had had suicidal thoughts. The university students who cannot cope with the mental obstacles tend to chose to drop out, drinking and drugs, self-harm or suicide. The office for National Statistics says that 112 full-time students took their lives in 2012.Nowdays, talking to someone, consulting to University counseling services, Student-led services or online self-help multiply the methods of regulating students mental health.
